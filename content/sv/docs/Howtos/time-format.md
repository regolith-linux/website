The time format (12 or 24 hour) can be specified in Settings:

The date format can be specified by selecting the appropriate region in Settings. A preview of the date format is provided, and logging back in is required for changes to take effect.

The date and time formats can also be explicitly set via `Xresources`. To do so, override the `i3xrocks.date.format2` `Xresource` key. The format specification for date is simply the arguments that would be passed to the `date` command on the command line. For example, to print the year in 4 digits, specify `+%Y`.
