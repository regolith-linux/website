  Release notes for Regolith 1.4.1
---

Regolith R1.4.1 is a fast follow up to 1.4 that fixes a few serious bugs, [detailed on the mailing list](https://www.freelists.org/post/regolith-linux/Package-Updates-to-Release). In addition to the package updates, a new boot animation is provided by the package `plymouth-theme-regolith` that is installed by default on the ISO. The ISO also now excludes a deprecated `touchpad` driver that was conflicting with Settings. Existing PPA-based installations can simply get the updates via their typical package update process. Regolith Linux ISO users can update to R1.4.1 by applying regular package updates.
