Regolith is composed of several existing open-source projects plus some additional custom packages.  Sometimes when a bug is found in Regolith, actually it's a bug in an upstream project.  Determining the source of bugs is a first step in getting them fixed.

## Check `gnome-flashback`

Most of Regolith's GNOME support comes from the `gnome-flashback` project.  To run a `gnome-flashback` session, install the session and log back in to your account after selecting that session from the login screen.

1. Install the `gnome-session-flashback` session:

```console
sudo apt install gnome-session-flashback
```

2. Restart your computer and then select the `GNOME Flashback (Metacity)` session as shown here:

3. Verify your behavior against Regolith.  If the problematic behavior also exists in `gnome-flashback` then the bug is likely there.  If the bug does not exist in the `gnome-flashback` then it's likely to be in Regolith.
