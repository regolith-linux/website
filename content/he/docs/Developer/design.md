  The philosophy behind Regolith form and function
---

- The **user's application** is of greater importance than any feature or facility of the desktop environment.
- Regolith branding should be enough to afford a **cohesive identity** to the user and nothing more.
- **Small pieces that can combine into bigger pieces** is better than larger, monolithic pieces.
- **Typography is the keystone** of the appearance of the system.
- **Less is more**. The ideal system is no system.
