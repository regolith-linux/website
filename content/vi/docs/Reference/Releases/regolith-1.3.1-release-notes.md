  Release notes for Regolith 1.3.1.

R1.3.1 is a quick followup to R1.3 that adds polish and usability features. Headlining features include a more concise way of overriding Xresource defaults and several enhancements to the Remontoire keybinding viewer.

If you maintain your own i3 config file, note that the copy shipped in Regolith 1.3.1 has changed in that the comment format has been modified to be readable by Remontoire ([example](https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-i3-gaps-config/blob/master/config#L37)). Without updating your copy i3 config comments, you will not see any keybindings.

| Ayu Looks                                                | {{< img "images/releases/regolith-screenshot-ayu-mirage.png" "New theme" >}}             | The community contributed Ayu themes have been fully integrated into Regolith with updates to package dependencies and configurations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Easier Customization                                     |                                                                                          | Now, overriding specific `Xresources` values can be easily done by supplying only the overrides in `~/.config/regolith/Xresources` without needing to copying and update any existing files. Additionally, any `Xresources` files in `~/.config/regolith/Xresources.d` can be referenced without absolute path, enabling easier multi-machine configurations. |
| Utilize GNOME and `update-alternatives` for Default Apps |                                                                                          | GNOME settings for default browser and `update-alternatives` for preferred terminal are now used by Regolith. No custom configuration changes are required.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
