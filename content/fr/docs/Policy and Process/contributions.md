  How to contribute to Regolith.
---

As an [open source project](https://github.com/regolith-linux), Regolith is open to anyone to extend, fork, or modify as they see fit.  Additionally, we welcome people to join as [contributors](https://github.com/orgs/regolith-linux/people) to the project. If you already have something in mind, please file an issue describing the change you're planning to make to Regolith, or discuss in the [Slack channel](https://regolith-linux.herokuapp.com/).  This ensures work isn't duplicated or effort wasted.  If you're interested in seeing what work is available to start with, take a look at the [list of issues looking for help](https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-desktop/labels/help%20wanted) to see what is needed.  To get a picture of the future, check [the roadmap](https://regolith-linux.org/news.html#roadmap). Regolith is a young project with much potential for improvement!

## Financial Support

As of the 1.3 release, Regolith has joined [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) as a way of receiving financial contributions from users. Financial contributions are vital to pay for infrastructure costs and fund future development of both Regolith itself as well as the upstream components that Regolith is composed of.

## Join our Slack channel

Click [this link](https://regolith-linux.herokuapp.com/) to join our Slack channel, which allows you to communicate with the developers of Regolith and other users. Here is where we brainstorm about new features, ways to improve current features, and fix bugs.

## Testing Fixes and Features

When bugs are reported by users, we try to have them verify the fix before enabling the update for everyone. Switching to the `unstable` PPA is necessary for Ubuntu to see that a new version of a package is available for testing a new fix or feature.  Once the update has been verified to resolve the problem and not cause any other bugs, it is promoted to the `stable` PPA for general consumption by Regolith users.  See [this section](../updates#package-promotion) for more details on package promotion, and see [this section](/docs/howto/change-ppa/) to learn how to switch between PPAs.

## Switching between PPAs

When bugs are reported by users, we try to have them verify the fix before enabling the update for everyone. Switching to the `unstable` PPA is necessary for testing a new fix or feature before it becomes available to the general population via an automatic update.  See this section for more details on package promotion.

## Official Regolith Contributors

Those that have shown aptitude and desire to help others, fix bugs, or add features to Regolith may be invited to become an official contributor.  Official contributors have more abilities with Regolith source repos and have a high level of trust and agency.

### Tasks

Regolith is a volunteer effort, and so there are no specific expectations regarding how much or in what way people contribute. However here are some tasks that are of great help to the project:

* Groom GitHub issues.  If an issue is pending a response from a user and there is no response from the issue creator, close it.  If an issue has been resolved but not closed, also close it.
* To learn about and contribute to the future roadmap, [see here](https://github.com/orgs/regolith-linux/projects) for project planning.
* As a young project, there are a lot of rough edges so if you want to work in fixes that's great but also if you're interested in new features that's fine too.
* Help with release planning.  We try for a release every 3 - 4 months.  Besides feature development and bug fixes, documentation and testing are needed.
* For new features, it is recommended to create a "request for comment" issue ([example](https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-i3-gaps-config/issues/6)) and allow some time for user feedback.  These RfCs will be advertised via the mailing list and official Twitter account.
