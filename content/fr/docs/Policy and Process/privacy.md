  User data and how it's used by the Regolith project
---

There is nothing in Regolith Linux itself that collects any user data, either anonymously or otherwise. Because Regolith is a customization of Ubuntu Linux, any data collection that Ubuntu is doing will also be performed by Regolith Linux. This website has vanilla Google Analytics integration.  Anonymity is a feature.
