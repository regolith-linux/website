  How to get support for Regolith
---

Regolith Linux is an open source project created and maintained by volunteers.  At this time there is no method for getting paid support.  [GitHub issues](https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-desktop/issues) and the [Slack channel](https://regolith-linux.herokuapp.com/) are recommended ways of finding fixes or asking questions.
