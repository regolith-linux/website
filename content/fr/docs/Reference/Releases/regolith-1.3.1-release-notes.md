  Release notes for Regolith 1.3.1.
---

R1.3.1 is a quick followup to R1.3 that adds polish and usability features.  Headlining features include a more concise way of overriding Xresource defaults and several enhancements to the Remontoire keybinding viewer.

If you maintain your own i3 config file, note that the copy shipped in Regolith 1.3.1 has changed in that the comment format has been modified to be readable by Remontoire ([example](https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-i3-gaps-config/blob/master/config#L37)).  Without updating your copy i3 config comments, you will not see any keybindings.
