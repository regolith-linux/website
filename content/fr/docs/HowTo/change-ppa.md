This page describes how to configure the package system to consume Regolith packages between a set of PPAs.  

## Regolith PPAs

See this section for a description of [each PPA](/docs/getting-started/install/#ppa-sources).  By default users will be on the `release` PPA which is intended to only be updated upon bug fixes and versioned releases.  Here is how to switch to the `unstable` PPA, by updating the apt packaging configuration:

1. Remove the existing `release` PPA:
```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:regolith-linux/release
```
2. Add the new `unstable` PPA:
```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:regolith-linux/unstable
$ sudo apt update
```
3. Upgrade packages to the upgraded versions contained in the new PPA:
```bash
$ sudo apt upgrade
```

### Switch Back

To return to the previon configuration, simply follow the steps above but toggle the PPA URIs.  So, swap `unstable` for `release`.

Once the PPAs have been switched, to revert any unwanted package updates from the `unstable` repository, simply install the specific version you wish to revert to.  For example, if `regolith-deskop` has version 4 in `unstable` and version 3 in `release`, you would have been upgraded to version 4 after using the `unstable` PPA and taking updates.  To revert back to version 3 after swapping back to the `release` PPA, tell `apt` the specific version you wish to install:
```bash
$ sudo apt install regolith-desktop=3
```
The general form is `apt install <package name>=<package version>`.  You will be notified by `apt` that the operation will result in a downgrade package version.
