        &lt;p&gt;There is nothing in Regolith Linux itself that collects any user data, either anonymously or otherwise. Because Regolith is a customization of Ubuntu Linux, any data collection that Ubuntu is doing will also be performed by Regolith Linux. This website has vanilla Google Analytics integration.  Anonymity is a feature.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2 id=&#34;configuration-files&#34;&gt;Configuration Files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regolith Linux is continually being updated with bug fixes and feature enhancements.  Regolith&amp;rsquo;s default configuration files live in &lt;code&gt;/etc/regolith/&lt;/code&gt;.  To customize these files, &lt;a href=&#34;https://regolith-linux.org/docs/howto/stage-configs/&#34;&gt;make copies in your user directory&lt;/a&gt; and make changes there.  These copied files in the user directory are owned by the user and will not be modified by Regolith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;package-updates&#34;&gt;Package Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notification of upcoming updates including those that may introduce breaking changes will be announced on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freelists.org/list/regolith-linux&#34;&gt;Regolith Linux Announcements mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.  Whenever possible, breaking changes will be confined to major version releases of Regolith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a package has been published to the &lt;code&gt;release&lt;/code&gt; PPA, Ubuntu&amp;rsquo;s built-in package update facility will find the update and either directly apply it or ask the user if they wish to do so, depending on configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;package-promotion&#34;&gt;Package Promotion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of Regolith happens via updates to source code kept in git repos within the GitHub Regolith Organization.  When a given feature or fix is ready for testing, it is published to the &lt;code&gt;unstable&lt;/code&gt; PPA.  After the change has been verified to work and not cause other problems, it is promoted to the &lt;code&gt;stable&lt;/code&gt; PPA.  Changes being preceived as high-risk will spend some additional time in &lt;code&gt;stable&lt;/code&gt;.  If a change is a feature, it will stay in &lt;code&gt;stable&lt;/code&gt; until the next version release, but if the change is a bug fix, it will be promoted to the &lt;code&gt;release&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;r1.3&lt;/code&gt; PPAs.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;As an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/regolith-linux&#34;&gt;open source project&lt;/a&gt;, Regolith is open to anyone to extend, fork, or modify as they see fit.  Additionally, we welcome people to join as &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/orgs/regolith-linux/people&#34;&gt;contributors&lt;/a&gt; to the project. If you already have something in mind, please file an issue describing the change you&amp;rsquo;re planning to make to Regolith, or discuss in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://regolith-linux.herokuapp.com/&#34;&gt;Slack channel&lt;/a&gt;.  This ensures work isn&amp;rsquo;t duplicated or effort wasted.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in seeing what work is available to start with, take a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-desktop/labels/help%20wanted&#34;&gt;list of issues looking for help&lt;/a&gt; to see what is needed.  To get a picture of the future, check &lt;a href=&#34;https://regolith-linux.org/news.html#roadmap&#34;&gt;the roadmap&lt;/a&gt;. Regolith is a young project with much potential for improvement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;financial-support&#34;&gt;Financial Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of the 1.3 release, Regolith has joined &lt;a href=&#34;https://opencollective.com/&#34;&gt;Open Collective&lt;/a&gt; as a way of receiving financial contributions from users. Financial contributions are vital to pay for infrastructure costs and fund future development of both Regolith itself as well as the upstream components that Regolith is composed of.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://opencollective.com/regolith/donate&#34;&gt;Go here to contribute to Regolith&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;join-our-slack-channel&#34;&gt;Join our Slack channel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href=&#34;https://regolith-linux.herokuapp.com/&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; to join our Slack channel, which allows you to communicate with the developers of Regolith and other users. Here is where we brainstorm about new features, ways to improve current features, and fix bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;testing-fixes-and-features&#34;&gt;Testing Fixes and Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When bugs are reported by users, we try to have them verify the fix before enabling the update for everyone. Switching to the &lt;code&gt;unstable&lt;/code&gt; PPA is necessary for Ubuntu to see that a new version of a package is available for testing a new fix or feature.  Once the update has been verified to resolve the problem and not cause any other bugs, it is promoted to the &lt;code&gt;stable&lt;/code&gt; PPA for general consumption by Regolith users.  See &lt;a href=&#34;../updates#package-promotion&#34;&gt;this section&lt;/a&gt; for more details on package promotion, and see &lt;a href=&#34;https://regolith-linux.org/docs/howto/change-ppa/&#34;&gt;this section&lt;/a&gt; to learn how to switch between PPAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;switching-between-ppas&#34;&gt;Switching between PPAs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When bugs are reported by users, we try to have them verify the fix before enabling the update for everyone. Switching to the &lt;code&gt;unstable&lt;/code&gt; PPA is necessary for testing a new fix or feature before it becomes available to the general population via an automatic update.  See this section for more details on package promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;official-regolith-contributors&#34;&gt;Official Regolith Contributors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those that have shown aptitude and desire to help others, fix bugs, or add features to Regolith may be invited to become an official contributor.  Official contributors have more abilities with Regolith source repos and have a high level of trust and agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tasks&#34;&gt;Tasks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regolith is a volunteer effort, and so there are no specific expectations regarding how much or in what way people contribute. However here are some tasks that are of great help to the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Groom GitHub issues.  If an issue is pending a response from a user and there is no response from the issue creator, close it.  If an issue has been resolved but not closed, also close it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To learn about and contribute to the future roadmap, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/orgs/regolith-linux/projects&#34;&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt; for project planning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a young project, there are a lot of rough edges so if you want to work in fixes that&amp;rsquo;s great but also if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in new features that&amp;rsquo;s fine too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help with release planning.  We try for a release every 3 - 4 months.  Besides feature development and bug fixes, documentation and testing are needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For new features, it is recommended to create a &amp;ldquo;request for comment&amp;rdquo; issue (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-i3-gaps-config/issues/6&#34;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;) and allow some time for user feedback.  These RfCs will be advertised via the mailing list and official Twitter account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Regolith Linux is an open source project created and maintained by volunteers.  At this time there is no method for getting paid support.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-desktop/issues&#34;&gt;GitHub issues&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://regolith-linux.herokuapp.com/&#34;&gt;Slack channel&lt;/a&gt; are recommended ways of finding fixes or asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;
