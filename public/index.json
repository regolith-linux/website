Unlike previous versions of Regolith, PPA and ISO installs result in different configurations. The PPA install favors coexistence with the existing Ubuntu desktop, while the ISO release optimizes for less resource utilization. Specifically, the ISO install is roughly 1Gb smaller and cold start RAM usage is reduced by about 200Mb as compared to the PPA installation.\nOption 1: Ubuntu Installer  Download an ISO image of Regolith R1.4  and then use an OS installation tool such as USB Creator to write the downloaded file into a USB device. Here are Ubuntu guides for performing this action in Windows, Mac, and Ubuntu. Reboot the computer and select the USB flash drive to boot from. Install or run the live environment by providing information when prompted during the setup process. See this tutorial to learn more about the installation process. When prompted, reboot the computer and login to your new Regolith environment!  Option 2: PPA  See below about PPA sources, and add your chosen PPA to your system:   $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:regolith-linux/release  Install the Regolith desktop package:   $ sudo apt install regolith-desktop  (Optional) install status indicators as default in Regolith 1.3   $ sudo apt install i3xrocks-net-traffic i3xrocks-cpu-usage i3xrocks-time $ sudo apt install i3xrocks-battery # for laptops  Reboot the computer, and when logging in select the \u0026ldquo;Regolith\u0026rdquo; session in the gear menu (⚙️):  From this point, please proceed to the next section, configuration to learn about the most common changes people like to make to Regolith.\nUpgrades Regolith 1.3 -\u0026gt; Regolith 1.4 The Unstable PPA ppa:regolith-linux/release is currently hosting Regolith 1.4.1 version packages. To upgrade an existing system to 1.4.1, update the package manager to source Regolith packages from the stable PPA:\n$ apt policy | grep regolith # Some info w/ URLs will be returned. Assuming http://ppa.launchpad.net/regolith-linux/release/ubuntu is returned: $ sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:regolith-linux/release # remove release PPA $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:regolith-linux/release $ sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt dist-upgrade $ sudo apt install i3xrocks-net-traffic i3xrocks-cpu-usage i3xrocks-time #also consider i3xrocks-battery i3xrocks-memory i3xrocks-weather After performing the update, log back in to your system. However, if you have staged your own i3 config file or Xresources root, read the below section Upgrading with Customizations.\nRegolith 1.0 - 1.2 -\u0026gt; Regolith 1.4 To upgrade from Regolith 1.0 - 1.2, the PPA URL must be changed and then new package versions are applied by the package manager:\n$ sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:kgilmer/regolith-stable $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:regolith-linux/release $ sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt dist-upgrade After performing these steps, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to log out and back again.\nUpgrading with Customizations When updating from a major or minor version (eg 1.2 to 1.3), it is often the case that new Xresource values and other config files have been updated. Existing Xresource and config files such as the i3 config file will need to be updated in order for the upgrade to function properly. If you\u0026rsquo;ve customized any Regolith config files or created a stand-alone Xresource file (~/.Xresources-regolith), these may need to be updated to take the upgraded files into account. A simple approach to doing this is to move them elsewhere, perform the upgrade, and then reintegrate any desired customizations into the new files:\n$ mkdir ~/regolith-backup $ mv ~/.Xresources-regolith ~/regolith-backup $ mv ~/.config/regolith ~/regolith-backup Once these steps are performed, logging back in should result in a \u0026ldquo;stock\u0026rdquo; instance of Regolith. From there, any changes desired to be reintegrated can be done by editing the new versions of the Regolith config files that exist in the /etc/regolith directory.\nEdits to /etc/regolith/... files If you\u0026rsquo;ve taken shortcuts and manually edited files owned by root in /etc/regolith or elsewhere, the packaging tool may not update the files, nor mention that stale files have been left. Even removing the package via apt remove ... may not result in a clean system. In this case, use the purge command to remove the package and manually delete any left over files. For example, to clean up the i3 config file:\n$ sudo apt purge regolith-i3-gaps-config $ sudo rm -Rf /etc/regolith/i3 # be sure to backup any important changes $ sudo apt install regolith-i3-gaps-config Troubleshooting Blocks Missing after Upgrade Regolith 1.4 changes the way in which blocks are installed and configured. This change is necessary to cleanly support the arm64 architecture and make it simple to swap out components like the notification subsystem. From 1.4 onward, blocks are installed by the package manager. See this HowTo on adding and configuring blocks.\nUpgrading Ubuntu Upgrading from Ubuntu 18.04, 18.10, 19.04, or 19.10 to 20.04 requires that the Regolith PPA be re-added once the Ubuntu upgrade completes.\n If the standard Ubuntu session is not installed, install it:$ sudo apt install ubuntu-session. (If you have it already installed this should cause no harm.) Perform the upgrade to 20.04. After rebooting, log into the stock Ubuntu session, not Regolith. Add the Regolith PPA, as the installation process removed PPAs:$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:regolith-linux/release Upgrade Regolith to the latest version:$ sudo apt upgrade \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt install regolith-desktop Reboot, and now select the Regolith session at the login screen.  NOTE: Some users have reported that regolith-desktop is automatically uninstalled during the upgrade. If this happens, simply run sudo apt install --reinstall regolith-desktop after the upgrade completes to restore the Regolith desktop session.\nReinstallation In the case that the Regolith desktop environment becomes corrupted or otherwise unbootable, follow these steps to reset it. No user files will be removed as part of this process:\n Login to the stock Ubuntu session. If this session is not available, install it with sudo apt install ubuntu-session. If you are unable to login, type ctrl alt F2 to access a TTY. After installing ubuntu-session, you will have the option to select the Ubuntu session type in the login screen. Uninstall Regolith from within the Ubuntu session:  $ sudo apt purge regolith-* $ sudo apt autoremove $ rm -Rf ~/.config/regolith/flags Verify that no regolith packages are still installed with apt list --installed | grep -i regolith. The command should not return any packages. If it does, manually uninstall them with sudo apt purge \u0026lt;package\u0026gt;. Reinstall Regolith:  $ sudo apt install regolith-desktop Reboot the computer, and when logging in select the \u0026ldquo;Regolith\u0026rdquo; session in the gear menu. At this point you can remove or keep ubuntu-session.  Uninstallation of regolith-desktop Simply follow these steps to remove Regolith from your system:\n Log out of the Regolith session and into the default Ubuntu session. Open a terminal and run:  $ sudo apt purge regolith-desktop \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt autoremove Now remove the PPA:  $ sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:regolith-linux/release To restore your GNOME settings, run:  $ source ~/.regolith-gnome-backup You can now safely delete the directory ~/.config/regolith.  PPA Sources There are 4 sources for Regolith packages. The release PPA is recommended for most users, but another may be better for you based on your needs. Here is a description of each PPA.\n   Name PPA URI Freshness Stability Description     Unstable ppa:regolith-linux/unstable Very High Low The unstable PPA is recommended for project developers and anyone that\u0026rsquo;s alright with troubleshooting their own system and doesn\u0026rsquo;t mind some problems from time to time.   Stable ppa:regolith-linux/stable High Medium The stable PPA is for those that would like the latest features, even between official releases.   Release ppa:regolith-linux/release Low High The release PPA provides bug fixes as they occur and feature updates upon release.   r1.3 ppa:regolith-linux/r1.3 Very Low Very High The r1.3 PPA is locked to the 1.3 release and will not be updated except for critical bug fixes.    ARM support Regolith packages are built for i386, amd64, and arm64 architectures. A stand-alone installer is not available for ARM-based systems such as the Rasberry Pi, however Regolith can be installed via PPA into an existing Ubuntu system.

For example, another look sporting the Solarized color palette and a different GTK theme and icon set is called regolith-look-solarized-dark.\nFinding Looks All look packages using this naming scheme can be found via the following command:\n$ apt search ^regolith-look- Installing a Look Looks can be installed via the apt tool or with any tool that can install Debian packages on the system, such as synaptic. For example, this command will install the Ubuntu look:\n$ sudo apt install regolith-look-ubuntu If you pay attention to the output of apt you may notice that in addition to installing the look, fonts-font-awesome will also be installed. As a feature, looks are able to depend on any resources or artifacts they require as packages. This ensures that once a look is installed, the user does not need to care about what other things that look make require to function properly. It\u0026rsquo;s taken care of by the package manager.\nSwitching to a Look Once a look has been installed, a utility command called regolith-look can be used to enable it. To enable the ubuntu look installed in the previous step, try the following:\n$ regolith-look set ubuntu $ regolith-look refresh The command will mention that it created a file in your user directory. This file is an Xresource file, and it\u0026rsquo;s stored in a specific path such that i3-gnome-flashback will look for it upon session start. Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at the file:\n$ cat ~/.Xresources-regolith #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/ubuntu/root\u0026#34; In essence, our Xresource file is simply pointing to another Xresource file. Lets look there:\n$ cat /etc/regolith/styles/ubuntu/root ! -- Styles - Colors #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/ubuntu/color\u0026#34; ! -- Styles - Fonts #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/ubuntu/typeface\u0026#34; ! -- Styles - Theme #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/ubuntu/theme\u0026#34; ! -- Applications ! These files map values defined above into specific app settings. #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/st-term\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/i3-wm\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/i3xrocks\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/rofi\u0026#34; #include \u0026#34;/etc/regolith/styles/gnome\u0026#34; Here we can see that there are separate Xresource files that define color, typeface and theme (icon, GTK), and these are loaded and then applied to the UI components integrated by Regolith: st (terminal), i3-wm, i3xrocks, rofi, and GNOME.\nRefreshing a Look There may be times that the UI of the system and the Regolith look get out of sync. For example, if a program sets the wallpaper or icon theme externally, this will not be reflected in the Xresource settings. Regolith will only update itself upon login if it detects of Xresource changes have been made. If you wish to force Regolith to reload the UI based on the Xresource settings, run:\n$ regolith-look refresh Learning More To dig deeper, read about Styles in the following page and have a look at the regolith-styles README.\n","excerpt":"Looks provided by Regolith have the package prefix regolith-look-. For example, another look …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/docs/customize/look/","title":"Look"},{"body":"Looks are a combination of Xresource definitions and associated resources such as wallpapers, GTK themes, and icons that as a whole provide the user with a distinctive user interface, all expressed as a collection of files. The default looks that ship with Regolith are natural starting points for creating new ones, but it\u0026rsquo;s also possible to start from scratch as long as the required Xresource entries are defined. Ideally, looks are packaged as Debian packages with all required resources either provided by the look or added as a package dependency. By using the OS packaging system, required files and resources are ensured to be installed and available.\nRequired Files Starting from scratch, the only mandatory file for a Look as a single Xresource definition file. This file must specify entries for Regolith\u0026rsquo;s required values, defined on this page. However, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to simply copy an existing look as a basis for customization, due to the compositional nature that Looks use.\nSuggested File Layout It is suggested that a look be installed in /etc/regolith/styles/\u0026lt;look name\u0026gt; and that the primary (or only) Xresource file is named root. Existing Regolith Looks decompose the Xresources into types of resources and any config specific to a UI component. For example the Cahuella Look provides definitions for GNOME (theme), color, and typeface and a specific theme for Rofi since it\u0026rsquo;s configuration cannot be completely expressed via Xresource key/value pairs:\n$ find /etc/regolith/styles/cahuella -type f /etc/regolith/styles/cahuella/theme /etc/regolith/styles/cahuella/color /etc/regolith/styles/cahuella/typeface /etc/regolith/styles/cahuella/root /etc/regolith/styles/cahuella/rofi.rasi Initialization When the Regolith session loads upon login, the initialization script looks in a few places for Xresource file definitions. The regolith-look tool provides the ability for users to change looks by creating an Xresource file that simply redirects to another file via the #include directive provided by the Xresources subsystem. In this way, a Look is enabled in Regolith by providing this link between a well-known Xresource file entry point to the files specific to the custom Look.\nPackaging The ideal user experience is to install a look via a package manager tool, and then using the regolith-look tool to set it. For example:\n$ sudo apt install regolith-look-ubuntu $ regolith-look set ubuntu $ regolith-look refresh In order to achieve this flow, all runtime dependencies (fonts, GTK themes, wallpapers, etc.) must be included in the package or defined as a Debian package dependency in a debian/control file. See the regolith-styles package for further information on Debian metadata. If you\u0026rsquo;re new to Debian packaging, here is an introduction.\nTesting Once you have a Look ready for testing, copy the containing directory for your files into /etc/regolith/styles, for example for a Look called orange, you may have this file layout:\n/etc/regolith/styles/orange/theme /etc/regolith/styles/orange/color /etc/regolith/styles/orange/typeface /etc/regolith/styles/orange/root /etc/regolith/styles/orange/rofi.rasi Then run regolith-look set orange \u0026amp;\u0026amp; regolith-look refresh. The UI should be updated with your new look.\n","excerpt":"Looks are a combination of Xresource definitions and associated resources such as wallpapers, GTK …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/docs/developer/looks/","title":"Looks"},{"body":"Regolith relies on the Xresource system to provide a consolidated interface configuration. By changing Xresource values, Regolith can be customized in ways such as updating the user interface, specifying custom behaviors, or defining a specific format for the clock.\nIn Regolith, Xresource values can be changed via two methods: supplying your own Xresource files, and overriding the existing Xresource values. The latter approach is strongly recommended, as it makes upgrading to newer versions of Regolith less likely to break. If you copy the Xresource tree completely, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to integrate any breaking changes in future versions manually.\n Initialization When a Regolith session is started, Xresources are loaded in the following order:\n   File Optional Notes     ~/.Xresources Y Intended for non-Regolith settings   ~/.Xresources-regolith Y A global override to replace all Regolith settings   /etc/regolith/styles/root N The default Regolith Xresource file if ~/.Xresources-regolith does not exist   ~/.config/regolith/Xresources Y Applies specific overrides to Xresource defaults    It is recommended to use ~/.config/regolith/Xresources for customization as it requires the specification of no redundant settings, and is easier to maintain over time.\nDetermining what values can be changed The xrdb tool can be used to list the existing Xresource values. See here for a table of existing values in the R1.4.1 release. Example:\n$ xrdb -query ... gnome.icon.theme:\tMoka gnome.terminal.font:\tJetBrains Mono 12 gnome.terminal.scrollbar:\tnever gnome.wallpaper:\t/usr/share/backgrounds/ESP_016895_1525_desktop.jpg gnome.wm.theme:\tAyu-Mirage-Dark ... Examples Note that the commands presented below append text to a file. So, running the command more than once will result in duplicate lines in the file.\nExample - Update the UI for High DPI Screens By using the ~/.config/regolith/Xresources override file, we will only need to specify the values we wish to change. The xrdb tool can be used to determine what current values are set to.\n Create or add the following value to your ~/.config/regolith/Xresources file:  Xft.dpi: 192 Reload the Xresource configuration:  $ regolith-look refresh Open a new terminal to see the change take effect.  192 is just an example value, please adjust as needed.\nExample - Change i3 bar position $ xrdb -query | grep position i3-wm.bar.position:\tbottom $ echo \u0026#34;i3-wm.bar.position:\tbottom\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith/Xresources $ regolith-look refresh Example - Change GTK Theme $ xrdb -query | grep gtk gnome.gtk.theme:\tAyu-Mirage-Dark $ echo \u0026#34;gnome.gtk.theme:\tAdwaita\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith/Xresources $ regolith-look refresh Example - Enable System Tray $ echo \u0026#34;i3-wm.bar.trayoutput:\tprimary\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith/Xresources $ regolith-look refresh Example - Use Alt instead of Win as Super $ echo \u0026#34;i3-wm-mod: Mod1\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith/Xresources $ echo \u0026#34;i3-wm-alt: Mod4\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.config/regolith/Xresources Then Reload i3 for the change to take effect.\nExample - Launch nm-applet when i3 starts Some users prefer to use the nm-applet program to configure and manage their wireless network. i3 config file can be updated to launch any arbitrary program at start time. But, rather than copying the whole file, we can supply up to 3 programs via Xresources without having to change the i3 config file. For this to work, also make sure that the system tray is enabled (see above).\n$ echo \u0026#34;i3-wm.program.1: /usr/bin/nm-applet\u0026#34; This change requires you to log back in before the change takes effect.\nRegolith generates many of these values from a canonical set of definitions. See this readme for more details. If you find yourself updating many values, it may be more concise to create your own look instead.\n Further Reading See the reference page for configrations for more details about config files in Regolith.\n","excerpt":"Regolith relies on the Xresource system to provide a consolidated interface configuration. By …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/docs/howto/override-xres/","title":"Override Xresources"},{"body":"Regolith is a collection of open source components that together form a general-purpose interface for using a computer, also known as a desktop environment [1]. Many of the UI components that are used to build Regolith are independent open source projects [2] that have simply been integrated, packaged, and configured for a specific workflow and visual aesthetic. Most computer desktop environments are optimized for ease-of-use and familiarity with commercial operating systems such as Microsoft Windows or Apple\u0026rsquo;s OS X. In contrast, Regolith provides a way of interacting with a computer that is optimized for user productivity and does not attempt to mimic legacy UI paradigms for familiarity.\nThe Keyboard, the Mouse, and the Monitor Regolith places emphasis on the keyboard input device over the mouse, in relation to most other desktop environments. This is for one reason: productivity. Specifically, the amount of time it takes to press a keybinding on the keyboard is less than the amount of time it takes your hand to move from the keyboard to the mouse, execute a series of clicks to get to a desired action, and then get your hands back on the keyboard. While this time difference is small, it adds up quickly due to frequent interactions.\nBut this benefit comes with a one-time cost: learning the keybindings. In exchange for this up-front cost, the user is subsequently able to perform general computer actions faster and with less foreground thought. Additionally, by pushing more of the computer actions into the user\u0026rsquo;s memory, more of the computer\u0026rsquo;s visual interface can be devoted to the user\u0026rsquo;s applications. Put another way, the Regolith interface devotes more bandwidth to the user\u0026rsquo;s application and less to the general management of the computer. And because ultimately the productive output of the user is a result of interaction with applications, the general productivity of the user is increased. This is a subjective benefit, and may be more or less important to the user.\nTiling Windows Perhaps the most user-impacting component in Regolith is the window manager, an open source project called i3-gaps (which is a customization of i3-wm). This program organizes windows into tiles. By default, i3-gaps divides the screen into sections for each window, all of which add up to the entire screen. If only one program is presenting a window, then that window occupies the entire screen. For two windows, both get an equal portion of the screen, and so on. By using keybindings, the user can tell i3-gaps to resize, move, and otherwise organize windows in other ways. A key advantage to this approach is that the user is freed from micro managing window layouts (at the cost of having to learn the keybindings).\nLaunching Applications It is common for desktop environments to display application launchers throughout the user interface, in the form of icons and text. Folders, docks, and context menus are used to present a form of menu to the user. Despite them appearing visually different, they are have one function: to launch an application. As with keybindings, in Regolith this user interface of launching apps is refined and minimized. Desktop icons, panels, and docks are not used. Rather, the user invokes the application launcher which presents a menu of applications sorted by frequency of usage. The user may begin typing the name or function of the application they intend to load and the list is filtered accordingly. In addition, frequently used applications such as terminal and browser have specific keybindings. With this UI treatment, there is no fixed overhead on the display for the presentation of application launchers. This provides the user benefit of more screen space devoted to the user\u0026rsquo;s applications.\nSystem Management Modern computers are complex machines with many observable attributes. For the day-to-day operation however, most of these can be ignored. Each user has a specific subset of system state they care about, and so there is no one perfect configuration for every user. By default Regolith provides on-screen state information on the bar for the user\u0026rsquo;s workspaces, keybindings help, network and CPU utilization, notifications, and the system time. More or less items can be configured by the user as needed.\nIn addition to the transient system information provided on the bar, the system configuration can be changed by the user via the Settings application. This configuration system is part of GNOME, and provides a rich set of UI pages to configure WiFi networks, Bluetooth devices, displays, and other devices.\nConfiguration Files While most of the common tasks of system management and administration are handled by graphical interfaces such as Settings, lower-level configuration is done by editing configuration files that are installed as part of Regolith. For example, to change what information is presented on the bar, or to tweak the border width of windows, editing configuration files is required. These customizations are covered in the customization section.\nWhere next?  Getting Started: Get started with Regolith The Interface: Understand how to perform actions in Regolith Keybindings: Learn the keybindings  Footnotes 1: The term came from a time when computers were large and were used on desks. That is no longer the case but we still use the term. A desktop environment is generally applicable to any computer with a keyboard, display, and some type of pointing device.\n2: See the interface page for specifics about the component Regolith is composed of.\n","excerpt":"Regolith is a collection of open source components that together form a general-purpose interface …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/docs/overview/","title":"Overview"},{"body":"There is nothing in Regolith Linux itself that collects any user data, either anonymously or otherwise.

Regolith is now smaller and more efficient. The ISO-based installer is now based from the Xubuntu image, and moves from the gdm3 display manager to LightDM. This allows for less resource consumption at runtime and dramatically smaller download size[1]. A new look, lascaille and file search dialog round out the major new features. Read below for more details.\nIf you maintain your own i3 config file, note that the copy shipped in Regolith 1.4 has changed in that it reads more configuration from Xresources. The intention of this change is to require a full copy of the i3 config file less often, by allowing users to customize the system via Xresource overrides instead of copy/edit of the i3 config file.\n For R1.4 in particular @ploum has provided many of the ideas and validation. Gratitude goes out to Regolith contributors and users @cheginit, @nalderto, @baldrailers, @ivomarino, @Josh-Letts, @LawZava, @SkyyySi, @tomster, @gdeflaux, @appelgriebsch, @farsil, and @MrKovar for their time and attention. Also thanks to all that helped to test and filed issues for bugs and feature requests!\nKnown Issues Issues and fixes are being tracked in this project.\nFeatures   Remontoire 1.3.1    Can render keybindings from i3 over socket or from any file. Can be configured to display on any screen edge. Visual updates and bug fixes. Presentation changeable via CSS.     New default look: Lascaille  A new look with a bolder, tighter typeface and a darker, higher contrast color theme become Regolith's default look in 1.4. Cahuella, and other looks continue to be available and can be installed with a few commands.   New File Search Dialog  Based on Rofi and mlocate, users can now quickly find files and launch their default editors from a global dialog.   Faster, Easier Customization  Virtually everything exportable from the i3 config can now be overridden directly with Xresources declarations, from changing the meta key to specifying the command that launches the app search dialog. Additionally, up to 3 user configured programs can be set to be loaded upon start. All of this is possible without creating a user copy of the i3 config file, but rather by overriding a specific Xresource.   i3xrocks supports conf.d style configuration  The status indicators in the bar can now be installed and configured independently. This allows for a cleaner dependency model and more efficient runtime characteristics. It also provides future flexibility for user contributed modules and status indicators. Plus, users can provide their own block descriptors in the user directory to easily override the defaults without having to change the i3 config file.   New architecture support: arm64  With testing done on a Raspberry Pi 4, Regolith now is installable via PPA when using Ubuntu on arm64 devices with the necessary hardware support.   Rewrite of Rofication  Rofication has been rewritten to require less dependencies and be more stable by Regolith contributor @farsil.   New Ubuntu release support: Focal Fossa  Regolith runs as a desktop environment in Canonical's latest release of Ubuntu: 20.04.   Time and Space Optimizations in ISO release  By switching from GDM3 to LightDM, Regolith avoids loading some unnecessary desktop components into RAM, resulting in between 200MB to 300MB savings on cold start. Additionally, the LiveCD installer is now based on the Xubuntu LiveCD which dramatically lowers the size of the installer and install image of the system[2]. Finally, with more fine-grained control of the bar status blocks, only the blocks you've installed will run.   Pluggable Desktop Notification Components  Users can now cleanly switch between desktop notification implementations such as dunst and notify-osd, in addition to Rofication without resorting to hacks.   Integrate gnome-terminal over st-term by Default  Regolith 1.4 uses gnome-terminal with a dynamically generated profile to overcome some character encoding and input devices. st is still available, simply by installing the regolith-st package.   Picom (Compton) config can be overriden by user  Users can provide their own Picom compositor config in their user directory.   i3 reload becomes Regolith reload  Refreshing the UI (look, colors, fonts, etc.) after making changes is now as easy as super shift r.   Polish, polish, polish  Just as in previous releases, many tiny fixes and enhancements were added to Regolith in version 1.4.    Fixes Have a look at the R1.4 project page for a list of bug fixes.\n1: This does **not** mean that Regolith uses XFCE4 or any other aspect of Xubuntu other than the install image.\n2: The trade-off is that users need to install more of the software they require after installation.\n","excerpt":"Regolith R1.4 is a major feature release which includes several improvements and optimizations. …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/docs/reference/releases/regolith-1.4-release-notes/","title":"1.4 Release Notes"},{"body":"While we\u0026rsquo;ll cover everything in greater detail in other areas of the documentation, this page covers the very basics.\nThe Super Key Most keybindings you\u0026rsquo;ll be using with Regolith start with the super key. This key typically says \u0026ldquo;WIN\u0026rdquo; or has a MS Windows logo on it. On a Mac it is the Command ⌘ key. Going forward, this key will simply be referred to as super but keep in mind that you can change which physical button super maps to in your configuration if you choose to.\nLaunchers Regolith provides several launchers are a primary way of interacting with your system. Each of these launchers has a consistent look and feel but provides access to a specific entity. Default launchers are provided for applications super space, commands super shift space, notifications super n, windows super ctrl space, and files super alt space.\nLaunch an Application After logging in, you\u0026rsquo;ll be at a blank screen with the bar at the bottom and some keyboard shortcuts on the right. To launch an application, press super space and a menu will be presented with all of the applications installed on the system. If you begin typing the name of the application you wish to launch, the list will filter down to only matching names. You can also scroll through the list with the arrow keys.\nNavigate to a Window To focus on a running application, the super ctrl space keybinding can be used to show a dialog of all running windows. Simply select the desired window and the system will move to the window\u0026rsquo;s containing workspace and set it\u0026rsquo;s focus.\nFind and Launch a File Searching your local computer for a specific file can be achieved in a variety of ways. Regolith provides a file search dialog via super alt space to quickly seek and optionally load a file with it\u0026rsquo;s default application. If the file path exceeds the width of the dialog, alt . will toggle text justification. Pressing enter on a selection will cause the file to be invoked with the xdg-open command.\nTerminal The terminal is a special application that has it\u0026rsquo;s own keybinding, super enter.\nBrowser The preferred browser is also special, and can be launched with super shift enter.\nQuit an Application super shift q will quit the focused application. For misbehaving apps, super alt q will force quit the focused application, but note that any unsaved data will likely be lost.\nSwitching Workspaces A primary way of managing how applications occupy the screen is by the usage of workspaces. A workspace is in essence a group of zero or more applications that all present windows on the same physical display. Users can switch workspaces to \u0026ldquo;gain\u0026rdquo; more space for applications to occupy. Windows can be moved across workspaces. Workspaces can be tied to physical display or be moved to other displays as needed. To switch workspaces, hold down the super key and press one of the number keys. This will navigate to that workspace. If any windows exist in a given workspace, it will show in the bar as being active. Thus, by referring to the bar the user can known of which workspaces active applications live.\nWorkspaces can also be paged forward and backward via super tab and super shift tab.\nConfiguring the System The Settings app (also known as gnome-control-center) is the primary interface for common configuration tasks, such as changing the desktop wallpaper, configuring wifi and bluetooth, configuring app associations, and setting up users. This app can be launched via the super c keybinding or from the Launcher via the Settings app.\nFurther Reading More keybindings are listed in Remontoire, the shortcut application. This app is loaded automatically on the first session, but not on successive logins. The window can be toggled at any time by clicking the circled i icon in the bar, or pressing super shift ?.\n","excerpt":"While we\u0026rsquo;ll cover everything in greater detail in other areas of the documentation, this page …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/docs/getting-started/basics/","title":"Basics"},{"body":"   Component Default Config User Config Notes      i3-gaps /etc/regolith/i3/config ~/.config/regolith/i3/config In Regolith versions prior to 1.2 this file was in another directory.

There are two primary ways of installing Regolith; via an Ubuntu-based installer and via a Personal Package Archive (PPA). Either of these methods will result in essentially the same user experience, although installing via the Ubuntu installer will result in a package selection that is different from installing vanilla Ubuntu. However by adding and removing specific packages a vanilla Ubuntu system can be configured.\nPrerequisites Ubuntu Installer  A modern computer that can boot from a USB flash drive. Free space on a local drive. The installer will allow for managing existing partitions or installing on an empty volume. An internet connection to install updates during and after installation. A monitor with at least VGA (1024 x 768) resolution. Regolith is optimized for FHD (1920 x 1080) screens. An empty USB flash drive with at least 4 Gb of storage space.  PPA  An existing Ubuntu installation with admin rights, version 18.04 or 20.04. 100Mb of free storage space to install the Regolith desktop environment. An internet connection to install updates during and after installation.  Deciding on Installation Method If you already have an Ubuntu system of a supported version, than adding Regolith via PPA is the faster and less disruptive method. The Ubuntu installer method is better for starting from scratch, installing into a virtual machine, or just ensuring that any existing software is not conflicting with Regolith.

See this page for more details.\n Regolith uses a number of files in /etc/regolith to determine the behavior and look of various components. While it\u0026rsquo;s possible to simply edit these files directly, users who do so run the risk of having their configurations overwritten upon future updates. The Debian packaging system should ask users if they wish to take updates or keep the existing files, but this may have unintended side effects if users take partial updates of files. As such Regolith, upon login, will look for user-staged version of configuration files and load those instead of the defaults if they exist. This is recommended over editing the files in /etc/regolith directly as it gives the user more control over their configuration. This page describes how to create these files.\nDepending on what you wish to change, you may need your own copy if the i3 config file, Xresources, or both. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking to change the way Regolith looks, Xresources may be all you need. If you want to update or add keybindings or swap out components, you\u0026rsquo;ll most likely need to stage the i3 config file.\ni3 Config  Copy the default Regolith i3 config file into your home directory:  $ mkdir -p ~/.config/regolith/i3 $ cp /etc/regolith/i3/config ~/.config/regolith/i3/config Log out and back in. The Regolith session will automatically detect your user-staged file and use that over the default in /etc/regolith/i3.  Verify the Change  Verify by running i3 --moreversion and noting the config file that is printed as a result. It should be the copy you just created. If not, be sure the path is correct. It must exactly be ~/.config/regolith/i3/config for Regolith to load it.  Regolith Styles  Copy the root Regolith Xresource file into your home directory:  $ cp /etc/regolith/styles/root ~/.Xresources-regolith Log out and back in. The Regolith session will automatically detect your user-staged file and use that over the default in /etc/regolith/styles.  Note that this root file is simply a reference to other styles that are broken down by the thing they are designed to style. For example, if you wish to customize the look of i3, you will need to also copy /etc/regolith/styles/i3-wm into your user directory and then update the reference to the new file in your ~/.Xresources-regolith.\n","excerpt":"Staging configs is no longer required as of Regolith R1.3.1 if you only wish to override or provide …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/docs/howto/stage-configs/","title":"Stage Config Files"},{"body":"As stated in the repo readme, Regolith styles are a convention by which a set of files which define key/value pairs are loaded into memory and can be queried by xrdb or xrescat. Xresources employes the C preprocessor to allow for complex behaviors such as including more files, defining constants, and conditional expressions. In Regolith, only two preprocessor directives are used: #include and #define. #include statements are used to reference other files. Collections of files called looks were covered in the previous section of this guide. #define statements simply allow for a symbolic value to be replaced by a literal value, like defining a variable.\nDefines To maximize the re-use of theme information in Regolith, Xresources are divided into two categories of files: definition files and application files. The definition files make heavy use of the define directive. They essentially bind an abstract key, such as \u0026ldquo;blue\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;terminal font\u0026rdquo; to a literal value, such as #0000FF or Source Code Pro Medium. In making changes to files, it\u0026rsquo;s expected that these defines will change. The user may wish to specify a different icon set, or typeface, and would do so by modifying or creating a new definition file. Once this file is created, it needs to be referenced by a top-level Xresource file in ~/Xresource-regolith.\nNote that when referencing other files in Xresources via the #include directive, shortcuts like $HOME and ~/ are not available. Absolute paths are required.\n Application Xresource files As mentioned previously, in /etc/regolith/styles lives a number of Xresources, including those for specific applications such as st or i3-wm. Opening these files will show a mapping of the abstract keys provided by the defines files to application specific keys. In this way, the general description of the look can be mapped to any UI component or application that can read from Xresources.\nLoading Order The i3-gnome-flashback session init script will check for the first Xresources file it finds in the following order:\n ~/.Xresources-regolith /etc/regolith/styles/root  In addition to a Regolith Xresources file, ~/.Xresources will also be loaded if it exists upon session start.\nAfter loading a root Xresource file, the session init script then merges any entries found in the ~/.config/regolith/Xresources file. This file provides a quick way of simply overriding a few values without having to copy the entire set of resource definitions.\nReloading Xresources The regolith-look command can be used to reload all Xresource entries as they are loaded upon session initialization:\n$ regolith-look refresh Alternatively, the xrdb command can be used to refresh specific Xresource files after they have changed. For example, to reload the user Xresource file run:\n$ xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources-regolith Verification You can test that a change has been made to your Xresources file by querying it from the command line. If a change was made to key foo.bar then the following command will return it\u0026rsquo;s current value, or empty if unset:\n$ xrescat foo.bar empty ","excerpt":"As stated in the repo readme, Regolith styles are a convention by which a set of files which define …","ref":"https://regolith-linux.org/docs/customize/styles/","title":"Styles"},{"body":"Configuration Files Regolith Linux is continually being updated with bug fixes and feature enhancements.

Many desktop environments integrate a compositor directly into the window manager, making it difficult to switch out or disable. In Regolith, the compositor is defined as a pluggable \u0026ldquo;extension point\u0026rdquo; in the packaging system. This means that compositors can be switched out simply by installing the packages that contain them. The underlying packaging system will ensure there are no conflicts and that all the dependencies of a given compositor are also installed.\nFinding Available Compositors The following command will list all compositors configured to work with Regolith:\napt search regolith-compositor- At least the following three compositors should be available:\n   Package Name Backend Description     regolith-compositor-compton-glx Compton The default compositor for Regolith. This compositor is modern, maintained, and handles screen tearing.   regolith-compositor-xcompmgr xcompmgr An early compositor that may offer more consistent performance if compton-glx is promblematic   regolith-compositor-none  A no-op package that does not run a Compositor. Best for absolute UI performance, at the cost of visual effects.    Installing a Compositor Due to the way that the compositor is managed by i3-wm, you must log out and back in for compositor changes to take effect. Restarting i3 is not sufficient.\n Run the following package install command to swap out the compositor. In this case we\u0026rsquo;ll run xcompmgr:\n$ apt install regolith-compositor-xcompmgr Log back in and the new compositor should be loaded. You can verify by checking the process list for xcompmgr:\n$ ps aux | grep xcompmgr Overriding a Compositor Configuration Compton/Picom To provide your own Compton/Picom compositor config, copy the default or create your own and save it as ~/.config/regolith/compton/config.

For example, to show a status indicator for your laptop battery simply run sudo apt install i3xrocks-battery and then refresh the session. To find what indicators are available, run apt search ^i3xrocks- or search for \u0026ldquo;i3xrocks-\u0026rdquo; in your favorite package manager GUI, such as Synaptic. Learn more about configuring status indicators in this HowTo.\nLooks Colors, wallpaper, window and bar layouts, and other visual factors are bundled together in Regolith and called \u0026ldquo;looks\u0026rdquo;. Looks provide a simple way of changing the entire look of the desktop with a few commands. At this time, looks can only be configured on the command line, but there is a script that manages the details for you. Like status bar indicators, looks are packaged and are installed and removed like any other software package. By convention, Look packages use the following naming format regolith-look-\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;. apt or a GUI package manager can be used to search for available looks. The tool regolith-look can be used to change looks and refresh the active session with the selected look.

Regolith uses Xresources as the canonical source of truth for settings, which are read by various UI components. The table of Xresource keys open to user configuration can be found here. To change the default super binding from the windows key to alt, add the following line to the file ~/.config/regolith/Xresources:\ni3-wm.mod: Mod1 i3-wm.alt: Mod4 To change other keybindings, creating a user copy of the i3 config file is necessary. See the staging configs HowTo to learn more.\nNote: GNOME also has it\u0026rsquo;s own set of keybindings. When the Regolith session is first initialized, the conflicting GNOME keybindings are removed from the user settings. GNOME keybindings can be managed in Settings.\nAlmost Everything Else Settings or gnome-control-panel as it\u0026rsquo;s also known, is the tool to configure locale, date, display, networking, and various other settings.

See this section for more details on package promotion.\nOfficial Regolith Contributors Those that have shown aptitude and desire to help others, fix bugs, or add features to Regolith may be invited to become an official contributor. Official contributors have more abilities with Regolith source repos and have a high level of trust and agency.\nTasks Regolith is a volunteer effort, and so there are no specific expectations regarding how much or in what way people contribute. However here are some tasks that are of great help to the project:\n Groom GitHub issues. If an issue is pending a response from a user and there is no response from the issue creator, close it. If an issue has been resolved but not closed, also close it. To learn about and contribute to the future roadmap, see here for project planning. As a young project, there are a lot of rough edges so if you want to work in fixes that\u0026rsquo;s great but also if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in new features that\u0026rsquo;s fine too. Help with release planning. We try for a release every 3 - 4 months. Besides feature development and bug fixes, documentation and testing are needed. For new features, it is recommended to create a \u0026ldquo;request for comment\u0026rdquo; issue (example) and allow some time for user feedback. These RfCs will be advertised via the mailing list and official Twitter account.

A key difference between Regolith and other environments described as minimal is the integration of the GNOME settings backend. This provides a well-tested, consistent, and friendly way of configuring your environment and computer. To load the settings app, launch \u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo; from Rofi or press super c.\nSettings is a special app in Regolith in that it is launched in floating mode. This is because typically when loading settings a user is looking to make a specific change and then exit back to their work. Once loaded use the tab sections on the left of the window to select which item you wish to configure.\ni3-wm The i3 window manager is not part of GNOME and so it\u0026rsquo;s configuration is not viewable or changable from the GNOME control center. Rather, the user must edit the config file and reload i3 to make changes. In Regolith, the i3 config file is at /etc/regolith/i3/config and users can supply their own copy that will override this default if placed at ~/.config/regolith/i3/config.\nMany things about Regolith can be configured in the i3 config file. It is best to read the i3 user guide to understand what and how to modify this file.\nMaintaining a user copy of the i3 config file requires more work when upgrading Regolith, as changes have to managed from the defaults into the user config to support new features in subsequent versions. If possible, it is better to rely on Xresource overrides to customize i3.\n i3bar The i3bar configuration is defined in the i3 config file listed directly above, but the i3bar has it\u0026rsquo;s own configuration for status items. To change which information is displayed in the bar, the config directory is /etc/regolith/i3xrocks/conf.d. There is one file in this directory for every status item, plus 01_setup. The prefixed number defines the order in which the blocks are displayed on the bar. See here for information about customization.\nLook The look of Regolith is configured via Xresources, that live in /etc/regolith/styles/. This topic is covered in detail in the Customize section of the documentation.\nSession When Regolith is initially loaded, a script is run that configures the system and launches i3-wm. While it is not recommended to modify this script, it can provide details about how Regolith is structured and what policy it implements when loading configuration. This file is readable at /usr/bin/i3-gnome-flashback. In fact, this script could be considered the initial seed of the Regolith project and was taken from the i3-gnome-flashback project.\n","excerpt":"GNOME control center (also known as Settings).

Keybindings Dialog  To allow for a more consistent look and collapsible content for various monitor dimensions, a custom shortcut dialog was developed called Remontoire.   Pluggable Compositors  The subsystem providing visual effects, the compositor, can behave differently based on hardware and driver support. Regolith now packages 3 compositor backends: compton-glx (based on Picom), xcompmgr, and none.   i3-snapshot  In office environments it is common to switch between various display configurations (desk, meeting room...). i3-snapshot allows the user to quickly save and restore existing window layouts in a session.   New Rofi theme  Based on work by /u/InfernusZ9, the Rofi launcher is less distracting.   New notification UI based on Rofication  The previous notification UI was a hold over from more traditional desktop environments that prefer to present an on-screen dialog when a notification is received. Because user-focus is paramount, this was changed such that an indicator in the bar displays the number of unread notifications and the user decides when to view them via a keybinding or button click.   Floating Control Panel  The gnome-control-center app can have a hard time adapting to constrained tiled layouts common with i3-wm. Now when the control panel is loaded, it floats above the existing windows to allow for a quick settings change without impacting other apps.   Clickable Bar Status Actions  For convienence, the default blocks on the bar will launch configuration apps for the associated block. For example, the battery block will launch the power settings control panel, and the notification block will launch the notification viewer.   Discrete and packagable Looks  The underlying style framework used by Regolith has been revamped to allow for \"looks\": colors, themes, typeface, and other thematic state. Looks can be switched with a single command.   New bar status components  Network, keybindings, notifications, focused window, and other blocklets have been improved and added.   Build System  Build scripts were added and improved to allow for the generation of Regolith packages in an automated fashion, making it easier for others to roll their own.   Website  An entirely new website is launching with R1.3, to integrate more content and make it faster for users to find information.    Fixes  i3-gaps-wm: Fix for workspace label bug on startup. Revamping some keybindings based on user feedback. i3xrocks: numerous tweaks and fixes for status indicators. regolith-gnome-flashback: numerous fixes and policy enhancements to session management.

However efforts have been made to create as much consistency as possible by utilizing a simple session-wide key-value configuration facility known as Xresources. Interface preferences such as colors and typeface are defined in Xresource files and then read by components such as Rofi and i3-wm. For the most part, Xresources can be used for higher level changes. Lower level changes, for example swap out i3bar for polybar or drun for Rofi require the removal, installation, and configuration of other packages.\nIn addition to the content in this section, refer to the tutorials for step-by-step examples of how to customize Regolith.\n Look The highest level change in the way Regolith looks is called a \u0026ldquo;look\u0026rdquo;. This ties together color, typeface, GTK theme and icons into a packagable unit known as a look. A few looks ship in the Regolith PPA, the default for R1.4 being called lascaille.\nStyles Regolith looks are a collection of style definitions that are bundled together as a cohesive whole. But, what if you want to mix and match from different looks or make small tweaks to an existing look? Well, the Xresource files that define the looks can be modified directly. For example, to continue to use the Cahuella look but change the default font from Source Code Pro to, say Ubuntu Mono, one would just need to modify the typeface Xresource file to specify the new font (assuming it\u0026rsquo;s already installed on the system).\nCompositors A compositor is a desktop component that provides visual effects to windows. While not necessary for a desktop to function, they provide some hints to the user regarding the focused application, transitions, and other effects. The performance and behavior of compositors can vary depending on graphics hardware and driver configurations. Due to this, special attention was made such that they can be easily swapped based on the users needs.\nComponents A deeper level of customization is to change which components are loaded and used. This is an advanced topic and requires both some courage to deal with the unexpected as well as general technical knowledge and some patience.\nPackages Regolith is ultimately a set of Debian packages that exist as collections of files on the user\u0026rsquo;s computer. Packages can be created and hosted by anyone willing and able to create a launchpad account and some skills with packaging.

By default users will be on the release PPA which is intended to only be updated upon bug fixes and versioned releases. Here is how to switch to the unstable PPA, by updating the apt packaging configuration:\n Remove the existing release PPA:  $ sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:regolith-linux/release Add the new unstable PPA:  $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:regolith-linux/unstable $ sudo apt update Upgrade packages to the upgraded versions contained in the new PPA:  $ sudo apt upgrade Switch Back To return to the previon configuration, simply follow the steps above but toggle the PPA URIs. So, swap unstable for release.\nOnce the PPAs have been switched, to revert any unwanted package updates from the unstable repository, simply install the specific version you wish to revert to. For example, if regolith-deskop has version 4 in unstable and version 3 in release, you would have been upgraded to version 4 after using the unstable PPA and taking updates. To revert back to version 3 after swapping back to the release PPA, tell apt the specific version you wish to install:\n$ sudo apt install regolith-desktop=3 The general form is apt install \u0026lt;package name\u0026gt;=\u0026lt;package version\u0026gt;.
